  > Propose a deep probabilistic kernel to address 1) traditional GP kernels aren't good at capturing similarities between high dimensional data points and 2) deep neural network kernels are not sample efficient. Has aspects such as Random Fourier Features, semi-supervised learning and utilizes the Stein Variational Gradient Descent algorithm.
* [On the expected behaviour of noise regulariseddeep neural networks as Gaussian processes](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/on-the-expected-behaviour-of-noise) - Pretorius et al (2019) [**arxiv**]
  > They study the impact of noise regularization via droput on Deep Kernel learning.
