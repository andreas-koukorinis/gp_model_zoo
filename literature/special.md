# Special Models

These are models that I deem 'special' in the sense that they're not exactly what GPs were originally tended for but they have usefulness in other fields. Some examples include:

* MultiOutput
* MultiTask
* MultiFidelity

#### Multi-Fidelity Modeling

> The users look at the case of multi-fidelity modeling using Deep GPs.
