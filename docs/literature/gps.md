# Gaussian Processes


## Best Resources

These are the best resources to use

* [A Visual Exploration of Gaussian Processes](https://distill.pub/2019/visual-exploration-gaussian-processes/) - Görtler et al. (2019)
* Neil Lawrence Lecture @ MLSS 2019
    * [Blog](http://inverseprobability.com/talks/notes/gaussian-processes.html) | [Lecture](http://inverseprobability.com/talks/notes/gaussian-processes.html) | [Slides](http://inverseprobability.com/talks/notes/gaussian-processes.html)
* Foundations of Machine Learning: GPs - Deisenroth (2018-2019)
    * [Slides](https://deisenroth.co.uk/teaching/2018-19/foundations-of-machine-learning/lecture_gaussian_processes.pdf) 
    * [A Practical Guide to GPs](https://drafts.distill.pub/gp/)
* Intro to GPs Demo by Damianou - [Jupyter Notebook](http://adamian.github.io/talks/Damianou_GP_tutorial.html)

### Other Resources

#### Standard Book

[Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning](http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/) - Rasmussen (2006)

This is the standard book that everyone recommends. It gives a fantastic overview with a few different approaches to explaining. However, for details about the more mathy bits, it may not be the best.


### Better Books

[Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/pattern-recognition-machine-learning/) - Murphy (2006)

A much better book which highlights a lot of the mathy bits (e.g. being able to fully manipulate joint Gaussian distributions to arrive at the GP).


#### Previously Compiled Stuff

So I found a few resources that give papers as well as some codes and lectures that you can look at.

* Into to GPs - [Super Compilation](https://ebonilla.github.io/gaussianprocesses/)
* Deep GPs Nonparametric - [Papers](https://github.com/otokonoko8/deep-Bayesian-nonparametrics-papers/blob/master/README.md)
* GPs for Dynamical System Modeling - [Papers](http://dsc.ijs.si/jus.kocijan/GPdyn/)

**When GPs meet big data** - [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.01065.pdf)
  > Probably the most comprehensive overview of GPs and how they can be scaled. You won't be able to learn each and every algorithm through this paper. But you will find almost all known algorithms for scaling standard GPs. **Note**: I don't think they mention Deep GPs.
