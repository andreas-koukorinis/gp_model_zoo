# Kernel Functions



---
## Software

* Multiple Kernel Learning - [MKLpy](https://github.com/IvanoLauriola/MKLpy)
* Kernel Methods - [kernelmethods](https://github.com/raamana/kernelmethods)
* [pykernels](https://github.com/gmum/pykernels/tree/master)
    > A huge suite of different python kernels.
* [kernpy](https://github.com/oxmlcs/kerpy)
  > Library focused on statistical tests
* [keops](http://www.kernel-operations.io/keops/index.html)
  > Use kernel methods on the GPU with autograd and without memory overflows. Backend of numpy and pytorch.
* [pyGPs]()
  > This is a GP library but I saw quite a few graph kernels implemented with different Laplacian matrices implemented.
* [megaman]()
  > A library for large scale manifold learning. I saw quite a few different Laplacian matrices implemented.
