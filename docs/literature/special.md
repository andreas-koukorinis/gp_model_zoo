# Special Models

These are models that I deem 'special' in the sense that they're not exactly what GPs were originally tended for but they have usefulness in other fields. I consider these algorithms in the category of "jacking around" (see Neal Lawrences lecture for the origin of the phrase). In my mind, these are algorithms that tackle a special case problem in the application realm. It's a bit difficult to verify how it does outside of the corner case due to no real comprehensive code-bases or benchmarks of GPs in real-world applications.

  > They use MVM methods to enable one to solve for functions and their derivatives at the same time at scale.

## Multi-Output Models 

In regression, this is when we try to learn a function $f$ or multiple functions to predict multiple output $y$ .

<details>
Concretly, we are trying to predict $y\in \mathbb{R}^{N\times P}$ where $N$ is the number of samples and $P$ is the number of outputs.

#### Terminology 

Firstly, there is some confusion about the terminology. I've heard the following names:

* Multi-Task 
* Multi-Output 
* Multi-Fidelity 

I cannot for the life of me figure out what is the difference between all of them. I have yet to see a paper that is consistent with how these are done. I have broken up each section based off of their name but I won't claim that there is no overlap between terms.
